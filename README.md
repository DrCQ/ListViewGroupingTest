# ListViewGroupingTest
This small WPF application (*PhotoBook*) shows a wrong behaviour of the `ListView` Control while using the Grouping functionality.
The basic functionality is implemented in the `ListViewPresenterView.xml` and `ListViewPresenterViewModel.vb`. This small app uses the `ImageItemViewModel.vb` class to provide a few properties for a small image icon as shown in the next picture.
